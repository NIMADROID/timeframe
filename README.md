The illusion works using a combination of a strobe light to and a fast repeating motion. Each flash of the strobe light is illuminating a slightly different position of the object that is actually moving too fast to see with the naked eye. Due to the small difference between the frequency of the motion and the strobe light, a slow motion effect is generated that suggests the object is only traveling very small distances from strobe to strobe. The frequency of the strobes is between 75 and 85 Hz and is not visible.
